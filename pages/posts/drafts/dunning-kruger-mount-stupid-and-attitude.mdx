If you've been in your career for just about any length of time, you might've come across something called The Dunning-Kruger Effect. If you haven't heard of it, Wikipedia has a [great synopsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) on it. It's the hypothesis that "people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability [to do the task]". As a chart, here's how that looks:

[Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](https://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2475) popularized a term called "mount stupid", which relates the "willingness to opine on a topic" vs the "knowledge of that topic".

This willingness to "opine on a topic" is likely because people get excited as they learn a new thing. When someone learns something new, sharing it with others is the next logical step &mdash; but why call it "mount stupid"? One of the stereotypes is that someone on mount stupid thinks they already know everything there is to know about the subject. This can cause a feeling of superiority and the person will negatively spout their knowledge with an attitude that isn't kind.

I think we all end up on mount stupid, but it doesn't have to be mount stupid. If you acknowledge the fact that mount stupid exists, you'll probably avoid being on "mount stupid". Will you still end up at the top of that mountain with your confidence at a great high only to realize you don't know anything? Definitely, but if you hold onto the knowledge that you likely don't know everything and have more to learn will change it from being mount stupid and just a normal learning curve.
