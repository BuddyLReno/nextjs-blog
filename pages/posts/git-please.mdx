As the size of a dev team grows, so does the likelihood of someone doing a force push and overwriting someone else's code.

Here's what a force push looks like in Git:

```bash
$ git push --force origin master
# `--force` can also be written as `-f`
```

This command can cause all kinds of problems. It basically tells Git that _I don't care what is in origin/master. What I have is correct. Overwrite it._

So what happens if a co-worker had changes committed to a branch that you haven't pulled down into your own repo? It gets overwritten, and your co-worker potentially has to re-do their work (or resurrect a commit or two if they still have it locally).
